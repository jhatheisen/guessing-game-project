The Objective:

Guessing Game Project

  It's time for our first non-spec guided project!
There are many projects in the course, some of which will not have test cases for you to run.
These types of projects will hold your hand less and force you to make design decisions.
Instead of specs, you will be provided with text instructions and example snippets to guide you.
In order to end up with a working project, you should analyze these instructions closely.
If you are stuck or don't understand an instruction, ask a TA for clarification!

The solution for this project is available at the end of these instructions.
Be sure to give it an honest shot before you take a peek!

The Objective

Our objective for this project is to build a simple game where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random.
Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large.
Below is an example of how the final product will play.
We've denoted the user's input with *asterisks*.
All other text is produced by the computer:

/*
Enter a max number: *20*
Enter a min number: *11*
I'm thinking of a number between 11 and 20...
Enter a guess: *15*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *11*
Too low.
Enter a guess: *13*
Too high.
Enter a guess: *12*
Correct!
YOU WON.
